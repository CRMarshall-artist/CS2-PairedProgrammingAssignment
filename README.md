# CS2-PairedProgrammingAssignment
Contains paired programing assignments for Computer Science II.

## Assignment Perogative
### Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to enhance your programming skills through collaboration with peers or with AI assistance. You will learn to tackle coding challenges effectively, whether by working with a classmate or by utilizing ChatGPT as a learning partner. This assignment emphasizes not just solving the problem but also understanding the process and best practices for learning how to program.

### Assignment Overview:

#### In-Class Pair Programming (Double Points):
Work with a classmate to complete the programming assignment.
One person will be the “driver” (the person typing the code), and the other will be the “navigator” (the person reviewing and suggesting improvements).
You should switch roles regularly to ensure both partners contribute equally to the task.
At the end of the session, submit your solution with:
The name of your partner.
A brief statement of who had fingers on the keyboard and how the roles were divided.
#### ChatGPT as a Programming Partner (Full Points):
If you choose to work independently, you may use ChatGPT as your programming partner.
Engage in a meaningful dialogue with ChatGPT to solve the assignment, asking questions, exploring different approaches, and learning new concepts.
Submit the full transcript of your ChatGPT interaction along with your solution.
#### Best Practices:

##### For Pair Programming:

###### 1. Communication:
Regularly discuss your thought process with your partner. Clear communication will help you both understand the problem better and develop a shared solution.
###### 2. Weekly Role Assignment:
Each week, one partner will take on the role of the “driver” (the person typing the code), while the other will be the “navigator” (the person reviewing and suggesting improvements). Only the driver should be actively working on the code during that week’s assignment.
Partners should alternate roles each week so that both of you gain experience in both driving and mentoring.
###### 3. Respect and Patience: 
Listen to your partner’s ideas, and be open to different approaches. Be patient, especially if your partner is struggling with a concept.
#### Reflection:
After completing the assignment, take a few minutes to discuss what you learned, what challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

#### For Using ChatGPT:

##### Ask Detailed Questions:
Don’t just ask for the solution. Instead, ask ChatGPT to explain concepts, provide examples, or suggest alternative approaches.
##### Understand the Code:
Before moving forward, make sure you understand every line of code provided by ChatGPT. Ask follow-up questions if something is unclear.
##### Experiment:
Use ChatGPT to explore different ways of solving the problem. Try out variations of the code and ask about the pros and cons of each approach.
##### Learn by Teaching:
Explain your understanding to ChatGPT. Teaching back to the AI can reinforce your learning and highlight any gaps in your knowledge.

### Submission Requirements:

#### In-Class Pair Programming:
Submit the names of both partners, the division of roles, and a brief reflection on the experience.
Optional: Instead of a brief text entry, you can upload a video summarizing your collaboration and discussing your roles.
#### ChatGPT Transcript:
Submit your code along with the full transcript of your interaction with ChatGPT and a brief reflection on what you learned.
#### Grading:
This assignment is graded on a pass-fail basis. However, those who submit a complete in-class pair programming assignment will receive double points as a bonus. Your submission should demonstrate a clear understanding of the problem and a thoughtful approach to learning.

## 12.8 LAB: Words in a range (lists)
Driver: Joseph
Navigator: Camryn

### Project Description:
Write a program that first reads in the name of an input file, followed by two
strings representing the lower and upper bounds of a search range. The file
should be read using the file.readlines() method. The input file contains a
list of alphabetical, ten-letter strings, each on a separate line. Your
program should determine if the strings from the list are within that
range (inclusive of the bounds) and output the results.

Ex: If the input is:

input1.txt
ammoniated
millennium
and the contents of input1.txt are:

aspiration
classified
federation
graduation
millennium
philosophy
quadratics
transcript
wilderness
zoologists
the output is:

aspiration - in range
classified - in range
federation - in range
graduation - in range
millennium - in range
philosophy - not in range
quadratics - not in range
transcript - not in range
wilderness - not in range
zoologists - not in range
Notes:

End the output with a newline.
All input files are hosted in the zyLab and file names can be directly
referred to. input1.txt is available to download so that the contents of
the file can be seen.

In the tests, the first word input always comes alphabetically before
the second word input.

### Joseph_List&Arrange.py
Joseph's original code.

### Joseph_List&Arrange(Edited-Marshall).py
My version of Joseph's code.

### input1.txt
Contains the list for Joseph and I's code to separate and sort.

### List&Arrange_Outputs.py
Contains my IDLE (Python 3.13) shell outputs for Joseph_List&Arrange(Edited-Marshall).
